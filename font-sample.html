    <p class="top">Once up on a horse</p>
    <p class="middle">A few years ago I was out camping with my kids near Crater Lake National Park and we decided to go out on
      a horseback riding trip. We sidled up to the nears horseback riding proprieter and reserved some horses. My 7 year old daughter 
      had her own horse and my 5 year old son was riding with me. We were travelling through some amazing high desert forests when we came
       around a corner and saw a black bear in the middle of the trail. The dog that was on the ride with us immediately ran towards 
      the bear and it took off running into the woods. We waited a nervous 5 minutes for the dog to return unhurt.<p>
